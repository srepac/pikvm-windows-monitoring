** BETTER WAY - Use included installer **

# Follow Step 1 and 2 as per the README.md file.

# Step 3.  Run the installer.  During the install, it will automatically open your default editor to edit the /usr/local/bin/poll-lhm.sh file.  Please change WINIP= line with the IP address of your windows target machine.
